Today we will share with you what we think are the best features of Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is an application specially designed for collaborative teamwork in an environment where project information can be centralized. Microsoft Teams is a workspace where every user has easy access to project files, conversations, and meetings. The application offers integration for apps to share content from your favorite services.

### Microsoft Teams Design

First, we have to show you the overall design of the application. The Microsoft Teams platform places content and conversations side by side. This area hosts activities, chat, teams, meetings, files, and apps.
